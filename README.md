# Elevator-Problem-Statement
The elevator system project developed with Django, Serializer, and API is a web application that emulates the functionality of an elevator system. It allows users to interact with the elevators through an API, performing actions like requesting an elevator, moving between floors, and checking the status of elevators. Django, a Python web framework, provides the backbone of the application, managing HTTP requests, database operations, and business logic. Serializers assist in converting complex data types, such as Django models, into formats like JSON for easy rendering. The API, implemented using Django's REST framework, exposes endpoints for elevator control and information retrieval. Together, these technologies enable the simulation of an elevator system through a web interface.
Serializer: Serializers in Django are used to convert complex data types, such as Django models, into a format that can be easily rendered into JSON or other content types. Serializers are essential for creating API endpoints and handling request and response data.
API (Application Programming Interface): The API acts as an intermediary between different software components, allowing them to communicate and interact with each other. In this project, the API is built using Django's REST framework, which provides a comprehensive set of tools and conventions for creating RESTful APIs.
Database Management: The project utilizes a database management system (such as PostgreSQL or SQLite) to store and manage the elevator system's data. Django's built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) simplifies the interaction with the database, enabling seamless data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.
